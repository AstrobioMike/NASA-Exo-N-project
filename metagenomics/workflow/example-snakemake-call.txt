# example snakemake call

snakemake --use-conda --conda-prefix ${CONDA_PREFIX}/envs -j 8 -p

    # --use-conda tells it to create the specified conda environments for each rule
    # --conda-prefix let's us point to where we want the environments created/used from
        # Without this setting, it will re-create them in the current snakemake directory each
        # time we run the workflow in a new location/on a new dataset. With this set, it will re-use
        # the conda environments we've made already.
